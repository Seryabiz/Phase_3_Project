# Assessment of the Conditions of Wells in Tanzania
## Overview
 Tanzania, a developing country, has a problem of providing water to its fast growing population of
 57 million. The country has already established wells that are expecetd to provide the much needed
 water, however, some of the wells require repairing for the goal of enough water supply to be met.
 Enthusiastic Environmentalists (EE), a renown NGO is interested in locating the wells that require
 repairing and repair them, and enable the country curb the water problem. I am the data scientist
 tasked with developing a predictive model to know the wells that require repairing. This will enable
 them cut the cost of survying, to pinpoint the exact wells that will require any repairing as using the
 model is easier to identify the wells without having to spend on nation-wide physical assessement
 ## Modeling
 Using the data on the wells in the country, I carried out data cleaning on the dataset, and then preprocessed
 it to make it ready for the classification modeling. The baseline model was the logistic regression 
 and I then made a decision tree to improve the performance.
 It is important to note that there are various classification metrics but the one used in this project
 was the AUC score metric as it is the most appropriate for a classification model with a binary target.
